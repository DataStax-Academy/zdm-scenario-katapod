![Phase 1a](images/p1a.png)

#### _üéØ Goal: creating the Target database (Astra DB instance) and verifying it is ready for the migration._

_The Target database you are going to create is an **Astra DB** instance.
This managed solution, built on Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢, frees you from
worrying about operations; moreover, it is a serverless architecture
that scales with your needs, avoiding unnecessary resource usage.
If you don't have an Astra account, [go create one](https://astra.datastax.com/): the **Free Tier**
can cover much, much more I/O and storage than what's needed for
this migration exercise._

**Note**: you are going to make use of the `astra-cli` [utility](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-classic/docs/astra-cli/introduction.html)
to perform most of the required steps from the console.
However, database creation and generation of an associated token are still done on the Astra Web UI:

- Create your [Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/) if you haven't yet.
- Create a database called `zdmtarget` with a `zdmapp` keyspace ([detailed instructions](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/)). _for the Free Tier accounts, stick to the GCP cloud provider and choose a region without the "lock" icon). The DB will be ready to use in 2-3 minutes._
- Get a "Database Administrator" database token from the Astra UI and store it in a safe place ([detailed instructions](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/#c-procedure)). _You will need it a few times throughout the exercise. For the migration process, a "R/W User" token would suffice, but a more powerful token is needed for the `astra-cli` automation._

Once this part is done, you can proceed in the "host" console.
The Astra CLI is preinstalled for you: configure it with

```bash
### host
astra setup
```

and provide the `AstraCS:...` part of the token when prompted.

Have the CLI prepare a `.env` file, useful to later retrieve the database ID:

```bash
### host
astra db create-dotenv zdmtarget -k zdmapp
```

Next, the CLI will download the "secure connect bundle" zipfile, for use by the sample application.
_Take a note of the full path to the bundle zipfile, you'll need it for the example API_:

```bash
### host
astra db download-scb zdmtarget -f secure-connect-zdmtarget.zip
ls /workspace/zdm-scenario-katapod/*.zip -lh
```

Finally, your Target database needs a schema matching the one in Origin.
Check the contents of the script file with

```bash
### host
cat target_config/target_schema.cql
```

and then execute it on the newly-created Astra DB instance:

```bash
### host
astra db cqlsh zdmtarget -f target_config/target_schema.cql
```

#### _üóíÔ∏è Your brand new database is created and has the right schema. Now you can start setting up the ZDM process, instructing it to use Astra DB as target._
