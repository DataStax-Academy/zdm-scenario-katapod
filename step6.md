<div class="step-title">Phase 1e: Connect the client application to the proxy</div>

![Phase 1](images/zdm-phase-1.png)

_üéØ Goal: switching the client application from a direct connection to Origin
to a connection through the proxy
(while still keeping Origin as the primary DB)._

The sample client application used in this exercise is a simple FastAPI process:
we will have to stop it (killing the process running the API) and start it again
specifying a different connection mode.

Before doing that, however, let's finish writing the required settings in
the `.env` file. Check the full path of the secure-connect-bundle zipfile
you downloaded with

```
### logs
ls /workspace/zdm-scenario-katapod/*zip
```

and the IP address of the proxy instance, e.g. with

```
### logs
. ./scenario_scripts/find_addresses.sh
```

_(this time, the two commands above will run on the still-unused
"zdm-proxy-logs" console for your convenience while editing the dot-env file.)_

and finally make sure you have the "Client ID" and the "Client Secret" found
in your Astra DB Token. Now you can insert the values of `ASTRA_DB_SECURE_BUNDLE_PATH`, `ASTRA_DB_CLIENT_ID`, `ASTRA_DB_CLIENT_SECRET` and `ZDM_PROXY_SEED`:

```
### host
nano +7,30 /workspace/zdm-scenario-katapod/client_application/.env
```

Once you save the changes (_Ctrl-X, then Y, then Enter in the `nano` editor_),
restart the API by executing the following, which kills the process in the "api-console" and launches it again:

```
### {"terminalId": "api", "macrosBefore": ["ctrl_c"]}
# A Ctrl-C to stop the running process ... followed by:
CLIENT_CONNECTION_MODE=ZDM_PROXY uvicorn api:app
```

This time, the API connects to the proxy. You should see no disruptions in the
requests that are running in the "api-client-console".

As a test, try sending manually a new status with:

```
### host
curl -XPOST localhost:8000/status/eva/ThroughZDMProxy | jq
```

and reading right after that:
```
### host
curl -XGET localhost:8000/status/eva | jq -r '.[].status'
```

The API is connecting to the ZDM proxy. The proxy, in turn, is propagating
writes to _both_ the Origin and Target databases. To verify this,
check that you can read the last-inserted status rows from Origin:

```
### host
docker exec \
  -it cassandra-origin-1 \
  cqlsh -u cassandra -p cassandra \
  -e "SELECT * FROM my_application_ks.user_status WHERE user='eva' limit 3;"
```

and do the same check on Target, i.e. Astra DB - this time pasting something
like the following `SELECT` statement directly in the Astra DB Web CQL Console:

```
### {"execute": false}
SELECT * FROM my_application_ks.user_status WHERE user='eva' limit 3;
```

Note that rows inserted before this switch are **not present** on Target.
To remedy this shortcoming, you must do something more.

_üóíÔ∏è The proxy is doing its job: in order to guarantee that the two databases
have the same content, including historical data, it's time to run a
migration process._
