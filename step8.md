<div class="step-title">Phase 3: enable asynchronous dual reads</div>

_üéØ Goal: putting Target to test by having the ZDM proxy
forward all read requests to it as well._

So far, the ZDM proxy has duplicated only the _write_ statements,
so as to ensure continued equivalence between the contents of
the two databases.

Enabling asynchronous dual reads (or "read mirroring"), you can subject
Target to the same read workload as Origin, thereby verifying its performance
in a realistic production setting. These reads, however,
are issued asynchronously by the proxy, so as not to affect the actual
performance your customers will experience.

It is desirable to keep an eye on the proxy logs during
configuration updates and restarts.
Even if, in this lab setup, the proxy container actually runs on the host machine itself, let's go through the motions of a real ZDM deployment, that is, first ssh to "the proxy host" and once there inspect the logs of the Docker container where the proxy is running. Run the following in the "zdm-proxy-logs" console:

```
### logs
. ./scenario_scripts/find_addresses.sh
ssh \
  -i /workspace/zdm-scenario-katapod/zdm_host_private_key/zdm_deploy_key \
  gitpod@${ZDM_HOST_IP} -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

You are now logged on to the ZDM proxy host. Have Docker print
the logs from the proxy container (in a non-stop fashion):

```
### logs
docker logs -f zdm-proxy-container
```

Now get to the console in the `zdm-ansible-container`: you will have to alter
the proxy settings and issue a "rolling update" of the proxy machines (a notional
concept in this case, since there is a single proxy, but that's the idea).

First open the `zdm_proxy_core_config.yml` configuration:

```
### container
cd /home/ubuntu/zdm-proxy-automation/ansible
nano vars/zdm_proxy_core_config.yml
```

Locate the `read_mode` line (down in the `READ ROUTING CONFIGURATION` section)
and change its value from `PRIMARY_ONLY` to `DUAL_ASYNC_ON_SECONDARY`.
Save and exit the editor.

Now perform a rolling update with:

```
### container
ansible-playbook rolling_update_zdm_proxy.yml -i zdm_ansible_inventory
```

**Note**: you may see the API issue a (recoverable) error
if it happens to receive a
write request during the (minimal) time with unavailable proxy. Don't worry:
in a real production setup you would have several proxies and the drivers
powering your client application would not even flinch at them undergoing
a rolling restart.

Meanwhile, keep an eye on the logs from the container:
they will stop (taking turns, if there were several).
Restart the `docker logs` command,

```
### {"terminalId": "logs", "macrosBefore": ["ctrl_c"]}
docker logs -f zdm-proxy-container
```

and look for a very long line (it's one of the first being written)
containing something like

```
### {"execute": false}
time="2022-[... ...] ,\"ReadMode\":\"DUAL_ASYNC_ON_SECONDARY\" [... ...]
```

Note the `ReadMode: DUAL_ASYNC_ON_SECONDARY` part in the above output.

If you want, check that the application still works by looking for the latest
rows being inserted in the output of:

```
### host
curl -XGET localhost:8000/status/eva | jq -r '.[].status'
```

During this phase, you can go to the Grafana dashboard and check
the behaviour of Target: in particular, looking at the
"Read Throughput" and "Read Latency" plots (both per-instance and aggregate):
there, any performance problem would be easy to spot.

_üóíÔ∏è The two databases are now guaranteed to be identical not only in their
content, but also in the requests they get (including read requests).
The next step is to elect Target to the role of primary database._
